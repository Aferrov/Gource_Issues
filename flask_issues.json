        "body": "Flask's documentation states that CSRF protection requires a form validation framework (which Flask doesn't provide), necessitating one-time tokens stored in cookies and transmitted with form data. However, modern browsers now support `Sec-Fetch-Site` headers, making token-based CSRF protection unnecessary. Rails just merged this approach in [rails/rails#56350](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/56350). Flask should offer a similar modern solution—but in a more Flask-like way: as a simple argument to `@app.route()`.\n\n## Current State\n\nFrom Flask's security documentation:\n\n> \"Why does Flask not do that for you? The ideal place for this to happen is the form validation framework, which does not exist in Flask.\"\n\nThis was written when CSRF tokens were the only viable protection mechanism. That's no longer true. And with header-based protection, no form validation framework is needed—just a simple check before dispatching to the view.\n\n## The Modern Approach\n\nThe `Sec-Fetch-Site` header is a [Fetch Metadata Request Header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Sec-Fetch-Site) that modern browsers send automatically. It indicates the relationship between the request origin and the target origin:\n\n- `same-origin`: Request from the same origin (same scheme, host, and port)\n- `same-site`: Request from the same site but different origin\n- `cross-site`: Request from a completely different site\n- `none`: User-initiated navigation (typing URL, bookmark, etc.)\n\nFor state-changing requests (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH), we can simply reject requests where `Sec-Fetch-Site` is `cross-site`. No tokens needed.\n\n**Browser Support:** All modern browsers (Chrome 76+, Firefox 90+, Safari 16.4+, Edge 79+) - [caniuse.com/mdn-http_headers_sec-fetch-site](https://caniuse.com/mdn-http_headers_sec-fetch-site)\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nToken-based CSRF has significant operational pain:\n\n1. **Caching conflicts**: Cached pages contain stale tokens → false positives\n2. **Session expiry edge cases**: Token/session mismatch after timeout\n3. **SPA complexity**: Managing token refresh in JavaScript applications\n4. **Multi-tab issues**: Tokens invalidated when user opens multiple tabs\n\nHeader-based protection eliminates all of these.\n\n## Proposed Flask Implementation\n\nRather than adding another extension, this should be a first-class citizen in Flask's routing. The implementation is simple enough that it belongs in core—just an argument to `@app.route()`:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\napp.config['CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS'] = ['https://accounts.google.com']\n\n# Protected by default for state-changing methods\n@app.route('/api/data', methods=['POST'])\ndef create_data():\n    return {'status': 'ok'}\n\n# Explicitly disable for webhooks that use signature verification\n@app.route('/webhooks/stripe', methods=['POST'], csrf=False)\ndef stripe_webhook():\n    return {'received': True}\n\n# GET requests are never protected (no state change)\n@app.route('/api/data', methods=['GET'])\ndef get_data():\n    return {'data': []}\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\n```python\n# Default configuration in Flask\nCSRF_ENABLED = True                    # Global kill switch\nCSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = []              # Allow cross-origin from these origins\nCSRF_PROTECTED_METHODS = {'POST', 'PUT', 'PATCH', 'DELETE'}\n```\n\nNote: Unlike my earlier draft, `same-site` requests are **rejected by default**. This is intentional—different subdomains often have different trust levels (e.g., `marketing.example.com` vs `admin.example.com`). If you need same-site requests, add the specific origin to `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`.\n\n\n## Questions for Maintainers\n\n1. **Default On vs Off**: Should CSRF protection be on by default for state-changing methods (proposed), or require explicit `csrf=True`?\n\n2. **Same-site Policy**: The algorithm rejects `same-site` requests by default (per Filippo Valsorda's guidance). Should there be a config option to relax this, or is explicit `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` sufficient?\n\n3. **Werkzeug Level**: Should the core check logic live in Werkzeug so other frameworks (Bottle, etc.) can use it?\n\n## References\n\n- [MDN: Sec-Fetch-Site](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Sec-Fetch-Site)\n- [web.dev: Fetch Metadata](https://web.dev/articles/fetch-metadata)\n- [Rails PR #56350](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/56350) - Rails implementation (merged Dec 2025)\n- [Rack Issue #2367](https://github.com/rack/rack/issues/2367) - Rack-level discussion\n- [Go proposal: CrossOriginForgeryHandler](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/73626)\n- [Blog from go author](https://words.filippo.io/csrf/)\n- [OWASP Fetch Metadata positioning](https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/pull/1875)\n\n## Willingness to Implement\n\nI'm prepared to submit a PR implementing this. The change is small and self-contained.\n",

        "body": "### Motivation\n\nWhen working on Flask applications with many API endpoints, it is sometimes\nuseful to quickly check whether all registered routes can be accessed without\nraising unexpected errors (e.g. unhandled exceptions, 500 errors).\n\nAt the moment, developers typically need to write custom scripts or tests to\nperform this kind of basic validation. Providing an opt-in CLI command could\nhelp improve developer experience, especially during local development.\n\n### Proposal\n\nIntroduce an optional Flask CLI command (for example, `flask check-endpoints`)\nthat iterates over registered routes and makes test requests using Flask’s\ntest client.\n\nThe goal would not be full correctness testing, but a lightweight sanity check\nto detect obvious runtime errors.\n\nPossible initial scope:\n- Only routes with simple methods (e.g. GET by default)\n- Skip routes with required path parameters\n- Report endpoints that raise exceptions or return 5xx responses\n- Development-only usage\n\n### Design considerations\n\n- The command should be fully opt-in and not affect existing behavior.\n- No network requests; use Flask’s built-in test client.\n- Keep output simple and readable (similar to `flask routes`).\n- Advanced features (custom payloads, auth, etc.) could be out of scope initially.\n\n### Open questions\n\n- Should this live as a core CLI command or as an optional extension?\n- How should endpoints with required parameters or authentication be handled?\n- Should the command fail on the first error or report all failures?\n\nFeedback on the general direction and scope would be appreciated before\nstarting an implementation.\n",

        "body": "### Description\n\nI propose to add a \"copy to clipboard\" button next to all code blocks in the Flask documentation. This will allow users to easily copy example code or command-line snippets with a single click instead of manually selecting the text. This feature greatly improves usability and convenience, especially on mobile devices.\n\nFlask documentation uses Sphinx for static site generation, and there is an existing Sphinx extension called [sphinx-copybutton](https://sphinx-copybutton.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) that provides this functionality out of the box. It can be enabled by simply adding it to the `extensions` list in the Sphinx `conf.py` file.\n\n\nThis extension also supports stripping common prompts (like `>>>`, `$`) from copied content, making the copied snippets cleaner.\n\n### Problem this resolves\n\nCurrently, users have to manually select and copy code blocks, which can be error-prone and inconvenient. Adding a copy button makes the process faster and less error-prone.\n\n### Additional notes\n\n- The change is additive and does not affect existing documentation content or structure.\n- This enhancement aligns Flask docs with modern documentation practices seen in many popular projects.\n\nI am happy to implement this feature and create a pull request once the issue is approved.\n\n",

That's not how context preservation works anymore.  It also causes the exception to not be passed to teardown handlers, but there doesn't seem to be any reason to hide that, and handlers can already choose what to do if they're passed an error.\n\nThe method is only documented in the API, not in any other pages.

        "body": "Currently, there are a bunch of different methods on the `Flask` class that run to dispatch each request. Many of these access `request` and other context proxies. We should update them to pass the `AppContext` everywhere instead. This is more convenient after #5812 with only one context object instead of two. As @pgjones pointed out in #5229, not having to access the contextvar is a significant speedup to ASGI Quart, although it doesn't appear to affect WSGI Flask as much. Perhaps if we were serving with greenlets and so contexts were switching more, it would be more noticeable in Flask too.\n\nThe obvious problem is that it is a breaking change to the signatures of all these methods. I'm unsure how many methods are affected, but I'm also unsure how many projects are even subclassing `Flask` to override any of the methods. The fact that the methods are public seems unintentional, compared to the much more common ways of configuring and customizing an app.\n\nWe could continue to support both signatures, showing a deprecation warning for the old one, by adding some detection to `Flask.__init__`. This would add some amount of time during app setup, but wouldn't affect runtime performance of the app.\n\n---\n\nAnother idea I had for the future was to have `@route` and other decorators inspect the signature of the decorated function, to allow injecting `request`, `app`, etc. if users would rather use that pattern than import the proxies. Having the request object directly available in all the dispatch methods would make this more straightforward. User code would be able to choose what pattern they want, the current proxy pattern would never be deprecated for user code.\n",

Take the following example:\n\n```python\n# flask_teardown_stream_with_context.py\nfrom flask import Flask, g, stream_with_context\n\n\ndef _teardown_request(_):\n    print(\"do_teardown_request() called\")\n    g.pop(\"hello\")\n\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\napp.teardown_request(_teardown_request)\n\n\n@app.get(\"/stream\")\ndef streamed_response():\n    g.hello = \"world\"\n\n    def generate():\n        print(\"Starting to generate response\")\n        yield f\"<p>Hello {g.hello} !</p>\"\n\n    return stream_with_context(generate())\n\n\napp.run(debug=True)\n```\n\nIn 3.1.1:\n\n```\n% /tmp/venv/bin/flask --version           \nPython 3.13.7\nFlask 3.1.1\nWerkzeug 3.1.3\n% /tmp/venv/bin/python flask_teardown_stream_with_context.py \n[…]\nStarting to generate response\n127.0.0.1 - - [01/Sep/2025 16:07:05] \"GET /stream HTTP/1.1\" 200 -\ndo_teardown_request() called\n```\n\nIn 3.1.2:\n\n```\n% /tmp/venv/bin/flask --version                             \nPython 3.13.7\nFlask 3.1.2\nWerkzeug 3.1.3\n% /tmp/venv/bin/python flask_teardown_stream_with_context.py\ndo_teardown_request() called\nStarting to generate response\ndo_teardown_request() called\nDebugging middleware caught exception in streamed response at a point where response headers were already sent.\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/tmp/venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/flask/helpers.py\", line 132, in generator\n    yield from gen\n  File \"/tmp/flask_teardown_stream_with_context.py\", line 21, in generate\n    yield f\"<p>Hello {g.hello} !</p>\"\n                      ^^^^^^^\n  File \"/tmp/venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/flask/ctx.py\", line 56, in __getattr__\n    raise AttributeError(name) from None\nAttributeError: hello\n\nDuring handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/tmp/venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/werkzeug/wsgi.py\", line 256, in __next__\n    return self._next()\n           ~~~~~~~~~~^^\n  File \"/tmp/venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/werkzeug/wrappers/response.py\", line 32, in _iter_encoded\n    for item in iterable:\n                ^^^^^^^^\n  File \"/tmp/venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/flask/helpers.py\", line 130, in generator\n    with app_ctx, req_ctx:\n                  ^^^^^^^\n  File \"/tmp/venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/flask/ctx.py\", line 443, in __exit__\n    self.pop(exc_value)\n    ~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"/tmp/venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/flask/ctx.py\", line 410, in pop\n    self.app.do_teardown_request(exc)\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^\n  File \"/tmp/venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/flask/app.py\", line 1356, in do_teardown_request\n    self.ensure_sync(func)(exc)\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^\n  File \"/tmp/flask_teardown_stream_with_context.py\", line 7, in _teardown_request\n    g.pop(\"hello\")\n    ~~~~~^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"/tmp/venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/flask/ctx.py\", line 88, in pop\n    return self.__dict__.pop(name)\n           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^\nKeyError: 'hello'\n127.0.0.1 - - [01/Sep/2025 16:09:35] \"GET /stream HTTP/1.1\" 200 -\n```\n\nSpecifically,\n\n```\ndo_teardown_request() called\nStarting to generate response\ndo_teardown_request() called\n```\n\nSo `_teardown_request()` is called before flask start to iterate on the response generator.\n\nThis is a simplified version of our own code; I'm not sure we can actually expect `g` to still be available during response generators, but given it worked in 3.1.1 and the phrasing / intent of `teardown_request()`, I'd expect it not to be called before the response is actually generated. Note also that removing the code which causes the error, i.e. the `g` access, and keeping just the `print()` for debugging, will still show `_teardown_request()` being called twice.\n\nIt's not obvious to me where exactly the bug is triggered. Adding a `traceback.print_stack()` call to `_teardown_request()`:\n* in 3.1.1, the only call, once the request is done, is triggered by https://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/7fff56f5172c48b6f3aedf17ee14ef5c2533dfd1/src/flask/helpers.py#L115 ⇒ https://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/330123258e8c3dc391cbe55ab1ed94891ca83af3/src/flask/ctx.py#L443 \n* in 3.1.2, the (new) first call before entering the response generator is triggered by https://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/330123258e8c3dc391cbe55ab1ed94891ca83af3/src/flask/app.py#L1527 ; the second is similar to 3.1.1, i.e. https://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/330123258e8c3dc391cbe55ab1ed94891ca83af3/src/flask/helpers.py#L130 ⇒ https://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/330123258e8c3dc391cbe55ab1ed94891ca83af3/src/flask/ctx.py#L443\n\nEnvironment:\n\n- Python version: 3.13\n- Flask version: 3.1.2\n",

        "body": "Hello team.\nDuring writing tests, I noticed a strange session behavior.\n\nI want to verify that after a redirect, the target location sets valid session properties, and it seems like in tests, the session properties when following redirects are not saved/exposed to the test environment.\n\nHere's an example:\n```python\nimport pytest\nfrom flask import Flask, redirect, session\n\n@pytest.fixture\ndef app():\n    app = Flask(__name__)\n    app.debug = True\n    app.secret_key = 'test_secret'  # noqa: S105 – fake secret key for testing purposes\n\n    @app.get('/redirect')\n    def do_redirect():\n        print(\"Redirecting to target endpoint\", flush=True)\n        session[\"redirected\"] = \"true\"\n        return redirect('/target', 302)\n\n    @app.get('/target')\n    def target():\n        print(\"Target endpoint reached\", flush=True)\n        session['foo'] = 'bar'\n        return 'Target', 200\n\n    return app\n\n@pytest.fixture()\ndef client(app):\n    return app.test_client()\n\ndef test_session(client):\n    with client:\n        response = client.get(\"/redirect\", follow_redirects=True)\n\n        print(f\"Session after a redirect: {session.items()}\", flush=True)\n        assert response.status_code == 200\n        assert response.data == b\"Target\"\n\n        assert session.get(\"redirected\") == \"true\"\n        assert session.get('foo') == 'bar'\n\n        client.get(\"/target\", follow_redirects=True)\n        assert session.get('foo') == 'bar'\n        assert response.data == b\"Target\"\n        print(f\"Session after a direct request: {session.items()}\", flush=True)\n```\n\nThe test fails on the first assertion `assert session.get('foo') == 'bar'`. \nIf I comment it out, the test output is the following:\n\n```\nRedirecting to the target endpoint\nTarget endpoint reached\nSession after a redirect: dict_items([('redirected', 'true')])\nTarget endpoint reached\nSession after a direct request: dict_items([('foo', 'bar'), ('redirected', 'true')])\n```\n\n**IMPORTANT**: The described behavior is not reproduced when running the application with the real HTTP requests.\n\nEnvironment:\n\n- Python version: 3.13\n- Flask version: 3.10\n",

This is a common accessibility and UX pattern on many documentation sites and could improve the overall reading experience.\n\nThis proposal does not affect Flask’s core library—it’s a suggestion for the documentation site UI only. I’m happy to help with a pull request if the maintainers are open to the addition.",

        "body": "`path_or_file` argument of `flask.helpers.send_file` is typed as `os.PathLike[t.AnyStr] | str | t.BinaryIO`. This prevents passing some objects that are `t.IO[bytes]`, but not `t.BinaryIO`. The underlying`werkzeug.utils.send_file` already allows `t.IO[bytes]` due to pallets/werkzeug#2209 since version 2.0.2.\n\n\nReproduction:\n```python\nfrom tempfile import NamedTemporaryFile\nfrom typing import IO\n\nfrom flask.helpers import send_file\n\n\n# The return type cannot be \"BinaryIO\" because \"NamedTemporaryFile\" is incompatible with it according to Mypy.\ndef some_function() -> IO[bytes]:\n    file = NamedTemporaryFile()\n    ...\n    return file\n\n\nfile = some_function()\nsend_file(file)\n```\n\nRaises the following exception with Mypy 1.16.1.\n```\nerror: Argument 1 to \"send_file\" has incompatible type \"IO[bytes]\"; expected \"PathLike[str] | str | BinaryIO\"  [arg-type]\n```\n\nI could simply change the return value of `some_function` to `_TemporaryFileWrapper[bytes]` or cast it to `BinaryIO`.\nHowever, I would like to allow `t.IO[bytes]`.\n\nSide note: `_TemporaryFileWrapper[bytes]` conforms to `PathLike[str]` due to python/typeshed#7840. That is why it is accepted by `flask.helpers.send_file`.\n\nAllowing `t.IO[bytes]` would be backwards compatible change as all `t.BinaryIO` are also `t.IO[bytes]`.\n[Mypy Playground](https://mypy-play.net/?mypy=latest&python=3.10&gist=4d7e2a43a847df9d332f5b7daba7a9fe)\n\nEnvironment:\n\n- Python version: 3.12.11\n- Flask version: 3.1.1\n",

For many developers, especially those working at night or with light sensitivity, this can create accessibility and eye strain issues.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nIt would be helpful if the documentation site could support an optional dark theme, either by detecting system preferences (prefers-color-scheme) or allowing manual switching.\n\n**Additional context**\nMany popular frameworks like: \n- Django\n- FastAPI\n- Pydantic\n- Typer\nhave added dark mode support in their docs, improving readability and user comfort.",

The query string is returned raw; unquote it manually (e.g. urllib.parse.unquote_plus) before using it for validation or filtering.\"\n\nWithout that notice, filters like\n\nif \"../\" in request.full_path:\n    ...\nif request.full_path.startswith(\"/admin\"):\n    ...\n\ncan be bypassed with %2F inside the query string.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPython version: 3.12.3\n\nFlask version: 2.3.3\n\nWerkzeug version: 3.1.3\n\nOS: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAcknowledgements\nDiscovery: Jefferson Gozanels GHomez\nProof-of-concept & report: Sebastián Alba Vives\n",

MCP is an open protocol that enables secure connections between host applications and AI model providers, allowing for standardized communication patterns in AI-powered applications.\n\n**Key aspects of MCP integration would include:**\n- Built-in MCP server capabilities for Flask applications\n- Middleware for handling MCP message routing\n- Authentication and authorization mechanisms for MCP connections\n- WebSocket and HTTP transport support as per MCP specification\n- Integration with Flask's existing request/response cycle\n\n**Relevant links:**\n- [Model Context Protocol Specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)\n- [MCP GitHub Repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk)\n\n### Problem Statement\n\nCurrently, developers who want to build AI-powered Flask applications that communicate via MCP must implement the protocol manually or rely on third-party libraries. This creates several challenges:\n\n1. **Boilerplate Code**: Developers need to write significant boilerplate to handle MCP message formatting, routing, and transport\n2. **Inconsistent Implementation**: Without standardized Flask integration, different projects implement MCP differently\n3. **Security Concerns**: Manual implementation may miss important security considerations built into the MCP spec\n4. **Maintenance Overhead**: Keeping custom MCP implementations up-to-date with protocol changes\n\n**Example use case:**\nA Flask application serving as an AI assistant backend needs to:\n- Accept MCP connections from client applications\n- Handle tool calls and resource requests\n- Maintain secure, authenticated sessions\n- Process streaming responses\n\nCurrently, this requires extensive custom code that could be standardized.\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nAdd Flask-MCP as either a core extension or built-in functionality that provides:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask\nfrom flask_mcp import MCPServer\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\nmcp = MCPServer(app)\n\n@mcp.tool(\"get_weather\")\ndef get_weather(location: str) -> str:\n    # Tool implementation\n    return f\"Weather in {location}\"\n\n@mcp.resource(\"user_preferences\")\ndef get_user_prefs():\n    # Resource implementation\n    return {\"theme\": \"dark\"}\n```\n\nThis would make Flask a first-class citizen in the MCP ecosystem alongside other frameworks.\n\n### Alternative Approaches\n\nWhile this could be implemented as a third-party extension (and some exist), native Flask support would:\n- Ensure better integration with Flask's ecosystem\n- Provide official maintenance and security updates  \n- Encourage broader MCP adoption in Python web development\n- Offer performance optimizations through deeper Flask integration\n\nWhat do you think?  🚀\n",

        "body": "## What's the issue?\n\nYou can use `template_filter` as a decorator, but it only registers the filter if you write an explicit name or an empty set of parentheses. If you call it without parens, the filter doesn't get registered.\n\nIt's a small difference and can be confusing.\n\n## Minimal example\n\nConsider the following program:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, render_template_string\n\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n\n@app.template_filter\ndef double(x):\n    return x * 2\n\n\n@app.route(\"/\")\ndef index():\n    return render_template_string(\"2 times 2 is {{ 2 | double }}\")\n```\n\nIf you run this app (`flask run --port 8008 --debug`) and then open it in your browser (`http://localhost:8008`) you'll get an error:\n\n```\njinja2.exceptions.TemplateAssertionError: No filter named 'double'.\n```\n\nThis is confusing, and it took me a while to realise the missing parentheses in `app.template_filter` were at fault.\n\n## Suggested fix\n\nI think it would be helpful if the decorator either:\n\n* Supported being called without parentheses, or\n* Printed an explicit warning if called this way, e.g. `Did you use 'template_filter' as a decorator without parentheses? You need to call it with 'template_filter()'`\n\nThis is caught by type checkers, but not everybody type checks their Python and the error message is less obvious:\n\n```\nArgument 1 to \"template_filter\" of \"App\" has incompatible type \"Callable[[Any], Any]\"; expected \"str | None\"\n```\n\nI've had a look at the relevant code, and I'd be happy to provide a patch if you think this is a useful change.\n\n## Environment\n\n- Python version: Python 3.11.11\n- Flask version: Flask 3.1.0\n",

Specifically, since it uses request.host by default to construct the external URL, applications that do not explicitly configure SERVER_NAME or sanitize headers can be vulnerable to host header injection.\n\nTo improve developer awareness and reduce misuse, we suggest: Add a warning to the url_for documentation about the risk of relying on request.host, and recommend the use of SERVER_NAME or trusted_hosts when generating external URLs.\n\nWe’d be happy to help draft the relevant documentation or contribute a pull request if this direction aligns with the maintainers' goals.\n\nBest regards,\nRui Yang and Zhengyu Liu\nJohns Hopkins University\n",

When the local development server (werkzeug) is started with option ``--reload`` the connections are not closed on reload, since Python 3.13 this is also logged with a [ResourceWarning](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.13.html#sqlite3):\n\n    ResourceWarning: unclosed database in <sqlite3.Connection object at ...>\n\nSince the application (since each thread) establishes various DB connections, the (debug) log is flooded with such warnings during development.\n\nI am aware that the DB connectors can be closed when the context is [torn down](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/patterns/sqlite3/), but this is not desired. The DB connections should be open over the entire lifetime of the server (thread).\n\nAnd the problem is not limited to sqlite3, in general, it would be better to close resources before reloading the modules.\n\nIs there perhaps a hook or another chance with which it would be possible to close open resources?\n\n\n-----\n\n*I placed it here as a feature-request .. may we better move this issue to werkzeug?*",

Specifically, the exception object retains a reference to the stack frame, which in turn holds a reference back to the exception. This creates a reference cycle between the traceback and the exception instance.\n\nThis becomes particularly problematic in applications where the garbage collector is disabled (gc.disable()). Even when the GC is enabled, this cycle puts unnecessary pressure on memory management.\n\nThe issue originates from the following line in the Flask source code: https://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/9225f8bb28d291b1610c8a58e3233aa6bbdc1808/src/flask/app.py#L1507\n\nThe fix is simple: the reference to the exception object should be explicitly released once it is no longer needed.\n\nA minimal reproducible example demonstrating this issue can be found here:\n👉 https://github.com/tomasz-pankowski/exception-memory-leak/tree/main\n\nEnvironment:\n\n- Python version: any\n- Flask version: 3.1.0 (earlier ones too)\n",

An example code snippet was provided in the issue.\r\n2. The user's report could be treated as a bug in the `int` converter, so the fix would be to modify the flask `int` converter to accept the other ~50% of legitimate integers. Assumptions were made about which part of the integer space most people would use. Concerns were raised about how users may be relying on this bug, and that it should not be fixed for fear of breaking said users.\r\n3. The user's report could be treated as a bug in the documentation, so a presumed fix would be to amend [the documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/api/#url-route-registrations) which currently states \"The following converters are available: [...] `int`: accepts integers\"; it could be changed to \"`int`: accepts _unsigned_ integers\".\r\n\r\nMy expectation would have been that either option 2 or 3 would be selected, but instead it appears that the issue was locked to further comment and no further action was taken. So, the documentation is still at odds with the behavior of flask vs the math and computer science definition of integer. I'm not wedded to either solution, but would the pallets team be open to implementing a fix in either direction?\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n-Andrew\r\n\r\n",

Here is a demo of what the results look like:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7937d1c2-ed41-4f38-be18-9cc29b9961a1\r\n\r\nObviously the `a.py` runs everytime in `flask run --reload` but reloads only when needed in `hmr app.py`. But everything else works fine (at least for this small demo)\r\n\r\nYou may say that user should use lazy imports and cache expensive calculations themselves, but in fact not every function can be cached, and lazy imports may lead to ugly code style. This can be solved with on-demand hot reloading without overhead. So I believe this is the future.\r\n\r\nAlthough this is just a minimal demo, but I value hmr's potential in the Python ecosystem, and believe that with our efforts this is a reachable goal.\r\n\r\n> [!TIP]\r\n> You can try the example above [here](https://github.com/promplate/hmr/tree/readme/examples/flask) with `hmr app.py`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAbout `hmr`, you can refer to its [README](https://github.com/promplate/hmr) for details.\r\n",

This makes the implementation pretty complicated, as we need to maintain two context var stacks, and do a bunch of checks in the request context to make sure we're managing the correct app context. It makes an already confusing topic more complicated to explain: app context is active for requests and cli commands, don't push an app context before making a request, etc.\r\n\r\nI think merging the two contexts could be possible. The single context (`ExecutionContext`?) would have the `g`, `request`, and `session` attributes, but accessing `request` or `session` when not in a request would raise an error.",

        "body": "The tests runned with `pytest` works with python3.11 and not in 3.12:\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce:\r\n```\r\ngit clone git@github.com:pallets/flask.git\r\ncd flask/examples/tutorial\r\npython3.11 -m venv venv3.11\r\npython3.12 -m venv venv3.12\r\n# install dependencies\r\n# setup db\r\n```\r\nIn both cases, the webservice runs properly with `./venv3.1x/bin/flask --app flaskr run --debug`.\r\n\r\nHowever, running the tests show different results. In `venv3.11`, the 24 tests are green. In `venv3.12` virtualenv, there is 6 failures (and 18 green). The failures are due to a `DeprecationWarning` which becomes an error:\r\n```\r\nDeprecationWarning: The default timestamp converter is deprecated as of Python 3.12; see the sqlite3 documentation for suggested replacement recipes\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe full output is provided at the end of the bug report.\r\n\r\nThe `DeprecationWarning` is documented in the [3.12 release](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.12.html): '[default adapters and converters](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3-default-converters) are now deprecated. Instead, use the [Adapter and converter recipes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3-adapter-converter-recipes) and tailor them to your needs.' Copy-pasting blindly the recipes in `tests/conftest.py`, `flaskr/__init__.py` and `flaskr/db.py` does not fix the errors.\r\n\r\nThe errors can be fixed by adding thoses lines in conftest.py:\r\n```python\r\ndef convert_timestamp(val):\r\n    \"\"\"Convert Unix epoch timestamp to datetime.datetime object.\"\"\"\r\n    return datetime.datetime.strptime(val.decode(\"utf-8\"), \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\").replace(tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)\r\n\r\nsqlite3.register_converter(\"timestamp\", convert_timestamp)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's probably not the best fix but it's a start.\r\n\r\n\r\nPytest output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(venv3.12) $ ./venv3.12/bin/pytest\r\n========================================= test session starts ==========================================\r\nplatform linux -- Python 3.12.4, pytest-8.3.2, pluggy-1.5.0\r\nrootdir: /home/stephane/src/flasktuto/flask/examples/tutorial\r\nconfigfile: pyproject.toml\r\ntestpaths: tests\r\ncollected 24 items                                                                                     \r\n\r\ntests/test_auth.py ....F...

        "body": "#998 was a discussion regarding the impact the `SERVER_NAME` setting has on an application.  IMO, there was consensus in that issue, including by @mitsuhiko, that `SERVER_NAME` being used both in routing and in URL generation was problematic.  \r\n\r\nThat issue was closed by https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2635, which made a change regarding subdomain matching.  However, IMO, it did not address the fundamental problem of `SERVER_NAME` impacting two disparate mechanisms in Flask.\r\n\r\nI found two additional issues since #998 that have attempted to point out the problem with `SERVER_NAME`: #2813, #3465\r\n\r\nIn #2813, a minimal, complete, and verifiable example was requested and I have therefore prepared an [example gist that demonstrates the problem](https://gist.github.com/rsyring/c50a500a5d35787ef45c1ff1e78d8898).\r\n\r\nThe gist's third \"currently impossible\" test demonstrates that it's currently impossible to:\r\n\r\n* Set `SERVER_NAME` so external URL generation works outside a request context with only an app context; and\r\n* Have the app respond properly to multiple host names. \r\n\r\nMy particular use case currently is that I need `SERVER_NAME` set so external URLs will be created accurately in distributed tasks where no web request is present.  Additionally, I need the app to respond to multiple host names 1) the canonical URL the public uses; and 2) the IP address based URL our load balancer uses for health checks.\r\n\r\nIMO, `SERVER_NAME` should be deprecated and two new settings should be created.  One which affects external URL generation and a second that affects routing resolution.\r\n\r\nThe setting for the URL generation could be `CANONICAL_URL` and, because its a URL, it could eliminate the need for `url_for()`'s `_scheme` arg.\r\n\r\nThanks for your consideration.\r\n\r\n- Python version: 3.12\r\n- Flask version: 3.0.3\r\n",

        "body": "Hi,\r\nI encountered a strange behavior of flask regarding cookies when the value of `SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN` is updated after some cookies have been set.\r\nI observed this with Python 3.11, Flask 3.0.2 and Werkzeug 3.0.2 with both Firefox 124 and Chrome 123.\r\nFirst of all, I could not reproduce the issue when serving on http://localhost:5000, so you might need to add `127.0.0.1 flask.localhost` in your `/etc/hosts` to be able to reproduce this, and access the app from http://flask.localhost:5000.\r\n\r\n0. Put the following snippet in an `app.py` and run it with `env FLASK_DEBUG=1 FLASK_APP=app flask run`. \r\n```python\r\nimport flask\r\nimport base64\r\napp = flask.Flask(__name__)\r\napp.config[\"SECRET_KEY\"] = \"super secret\"\r\napp.config[\"SERVER_NAME\"] = \"flask.localhost:5000\"\r\napp.config[\"SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN\"] = app.config[\"SERVER_NAME\"]\r\n\r\n@app.route(\"/\", methods=(\"GET\", \"POST\"))\r\ndef index():\r\n    if flask.request.form:\r\n        flask.session[\"value\"] = flask.request.form[\"value\"]\r\n\r\n    session_cookies = [\r\n        base64.b64decode(cookie.split(\".\")[0]).decode()\r\n        for cookie in flask.request.cookies.getlist(\"session\")\r\n    ]\r\n    return (\r\n        '<form action=\"/\" method=\"post\"><input name=\"value\"><input type=\"submit\"></form\"><br>\\n'\r\n        + f'value {flask.session.get(\"value\")}<br>\\n'\r\n        + \"cookies: \" + \" \".join(session_cookies)\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. **Open http://flask.localhost:5000, clean the cookies if existing.**\r\n`flask.session` is empty.\r\n3. **Write `foo` in the form, validate.**\r\n`session[\"value\"]` contains `foo`.\r\n4. **Reload the page**\r\n`session[\"value\"]` still contains `foo`.\r\nThe firefox dev tools indicate that the cookie domain is `.flask.localhost` (with a leading dot).\r\n5. **Comment the `app.config[\"SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN\"] = app.config[\"SERVER_NAME\"]` line**\r\n6. **Reload the page**\r\n`session[\"value\"]` still contains `foo`.\r\n7. **Write `bar` in the form, validate.**\r\n`session[\"value\"]` still contains `bar`.\r\n8. **Reload the page**\r\n`session[\"value\"]` contains `foo`, which is unexpected.\r\nA cookie has been set on step 6, and the firefox dev tools indicate that the cookie domain is `flask.localhost` (without a leading dot).\r\nHowever it seems the value is read from the step 2. cookie. that is still around.\r\n`flask.request.cookies.getlist(\"session\")` contains two cookies, with the values `foo` and `bar`.\r\n\r\nThose steps work also by starting with the `SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN` commented and then uncomment it at step 4.\r\nThe issue is not reproductible without the `app.config[\"SERVER_NAME\"] = \"flask.localhost:5000\"` line.\r\n\r\nThe [SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/config/#SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN) mentions that different values produce different cookies. However it does not mention that different cookies could conflict, neither that changing the value should be avoided.\r\n\r\nMaybe there is some misconfiguration on my side (is it?) but nonetheless it feels strange that Flask could write in one session cookie (step 6.) and then read from another session cookie (step 7.).\r\n\r\nDeleting the cookies solve the situation, however I can not expect the users of my production application to delete their cookies so the application is functionning again. And the curse is that some of my users have their cookies created with subdomains support, and some other have their cookies without subdomains support. So setting or deleting `SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN` will fix the issue for ones while provoking it for the other ones.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?",

The images have a resolution of 600x600 and weight ~700 kB per image. Images are in png format. I have created a minimal flask application with one endpoint. The application is served using a waitress.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that sometimes response time from an endpoint suddenly increases by an order of magnitude. As I have to fit in a certain amount of time, such spikes can cause a critical error.\r\n\r\nI ran a cProfile on the post request and found out that when there is a spike two functions take more time than normal:\r\n\r\n**Normal**\r\n\r\n```\r\nncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)\r\n     2    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {method 'sendall' of '_socket.socket' objects}\r\n     1    0.004    0.004    0.004    0.004 {method 'recv_into' of '_socket.socket' objects}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Spike**\r\n\r\n```\r\nncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)\r\n     2    0.008    0.004    0.008    0.004 {method 'sendall' of '_socket.socket' objects}\r\n     1    0.012    0.012    0.012    0.012 {method 'recv_into' of '_socket.socket' objects}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat is the cause of these spikes, and can they be resolved in some way?\r\n\r\nCode to reproduce:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# app.py\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom flask import Flask, request\r\n\r\n\r\ndef create_app():\r\n    app = Flask(__name__)\r\n\r\n    @app.route(\"/endpoint\")\r\n    def endpoint():\r\n        data = request.data\r\n        img_arr = np.frombuffer(data, dtype=np.uint8)\r\n        # ...\r\n        return {\"foo\": \"bar\"}\r\n\r\n    return app\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n# wsgi.py\r\nfrom waitress import serve\r\n\r\nfrom app import create_app\r\n\r\n\r\ndef main():\r\n    app = create_app()\r\n    serve(app, host=\"0.0.0.0\", port=\"9009\")\r\n\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    main()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n# send.py\r\n\r\nfrom pathlib import Path\r\n\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport requests\r\nfrom PIL import Image\r\n\r\n\r\ndef main():\r\n    img_paths = list(Path(\"images\").rglob(\"*.png\"))\r\n    ses = requests.Session()\r\n    speeds = []\r\n    for img_path in img_paths:\r\n        img_arr = np.asarray(Image.open(img_path))\r\n        response = ses.post(url='http://0.0.0.0:9009/endpoint', data=img_arr.tobytes())\r\n        speeds.append(response.elapsed.total_seconds())\r\n\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    main()\r\n```\r\n\r\nPython and package versions:\r\n\r\n```\r\npython==3.8.18\r\n\r\nFlask==3.0.2\r\nnumpy==1.24.4\r\npillow==10.2.0\r\nrequests==2.31.0\r\nwaitress==3.0.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThree independent performances for 1,000 images:\r\n\r\n[First](https://i.stack.imgur.com/53GEa.png)\r\n\r\n[Second](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1iFrD.png)\r\n\r\n[Third](https://i.stack.imgur.com/TxCpV.png)",
